Yes, you heard me right. I've been wanting to do this for a long time now, and I finally got some time to make it real.
Where do I start? hmmm... lets see
>1. I do have a lot of things on my mind, from school (even though it is the holidays), family matters and just YouTube, it is mostly my own laziness and ADHD

so yeah. thats it for now, bye
